# lightlink hackathon
I built a web app wallet demo that connects to other dapps and enables seamless tractions, for each address, a savings contact is connected to it, wherein, every transaction is rounded up in dollars and the difference is sent to the savings contract for a specific period of time, during creation, users can specify the lock duration they are interested in. With a mininum of 1 month. The wallet also performs other wallet functionalities such as sending and receivng tokens, qr code for address, and using blockscout to get the token balances for the savings contract and the address. 

The smart contract code can be found in '/src/contract/contracts/TimeLock.sol'
